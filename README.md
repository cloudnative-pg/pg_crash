# PostgreSQL images with pg_crash

This repository has two major goals:

1. Build images of all supported PostgreSQL versions with the
   ["pg_crash"](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pg_crash)
   extension for Chaos Monkey.

2. Run scheduled tests for the latest container images of each
   major Postgres version on a cluster built with the
   [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) operator.
